From dreamlike landscapes to urban wonders, the images portray the tender interplay between natural formations and the contemporary world. Frequently taken from a distance, in an almost voyeuristic perspective, the photographer separates herself from the scene only to capture the most natural of moments. Printed on museum quality fine art paper.",
