Both vengeance and passion only bring us closer. To collide or embrace, we only come closer. In contest or cooperation, we’re always coming closer. To know the other is to know yourself, and what a terrible burden that knowing is. No wonder you want to look away.",

We’re not separate lives, but one big life. We’re not divergent streams, but eddies in a single river. Even against our will, the current of time urges us forward. Even in disharmony, we move in the same direction. Even when we’re lost, we’re not without a destination. But you set the course of your life by your will. So pay attention to where you’re going, because you’re pulling us along with you.",
