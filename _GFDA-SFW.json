But, when you’ve finally found your limit, which will be so far from your impossible goal, when you can go no further and there’s nothing left, you’ll know, at last, without doubt or regret, that nothing is so worth years of pain as a single moment of glory.",

It’s the breadth of your resilience, the depth of your conviction, the height of your character. It’s not in the stars or in the cards. It’s not in the graces of the powerful, nor in the cheers of the crowd. It’s not a thing to be obtained, but one to be called forth. It’s within you. It’s your spirit. It’s your very fiber. It’s in you now, just as it’s always been. You only need to believe. Your power far exceeds your limits. Will it into being. Right now. Why do you hesitate?",

Behind that ego, one soul needs all others. The bond can’t be broken. All your twisting only tangles us further. All your pulling only draws us closer. Both vengeance and passion only bring us closer. To collide or embrace, we only come closer. In contest or cooperation, we’re always coming closer. To know the other is to know yourself, and what a terrible burden that knowing is. No wonder you want to look away.",

We’re not separate lives, but one big life. We’re not divergent streams, but eddies in a single river. Even against our will, the current of time urges us forward. Even in disharmony, we move in the same direction. Even when we’re lost, we’re not without a destination. But you set the course of your life by your will. So pay attention to where you’re going, because you’re pulling us along with you.",
