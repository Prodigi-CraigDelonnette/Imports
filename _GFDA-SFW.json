You can’t see the value in that struggle until you’re looking back on it. Steep and treacherous though it is, no one else can follow your path for you. You’re strong enough. You have it in you.

Not the loss, but the recovery. Not the droughts or the floods, but the rhythm of seasons. You won’t see the struggle, but its meaning: that you are better now than you were before.

                    "description": "No. 469 / Your flaws make you unique. <p>Every flaw is balanced by a grace. The one you choose to dwell on comes to define you. To be beautiful is to be blemished in the perfect way, and beauty is elevating. To stoke the inner fire is to be consumed, but others are warmed. To love is to hurt, but also to heal. To live at all is to suffer, to strain, to always be aware of the inevitable end of living; but life is beautiful, and warm, and it offers the chance to love. So can you bear the worst of it and celebrate the best?",
